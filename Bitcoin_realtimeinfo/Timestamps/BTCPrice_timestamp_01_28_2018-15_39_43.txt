# API

## What Is API?

Bitstamp application programming interface (API) allows our clients to access
and control their accounts, using custom written software.

With the inclusion of the new BTC/EUR currency pair, we've added new endpoints
for some API calls (info about specific calls below). **The old endpoints are
still available and have not changed.** We strongly suggest however, that you
refer to the v2 API for future references. Please note that API v2 endpoints
rounding is different, than the one used on the old endpoints.

## Request limits

Do not make more than 600 requests per 10 minutes or we will ban your IP
address. For real time data please refer to the [websocket API](/websocket/).

# API authentication

All private API calls require authentication. For a successful authentication
you need to provide **your API key** , a **signature** and a **nonce**
parameter.

#### API key

To get an API key, go to "Account", "Security" and then "API Access". Set
permissions and click "Generate key".

#### Nonce

Nonce is a regular integer number. It must be increased with every request you
make. Read more about it
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce). Example: if you set
nonce to 1 in your first request, you must set it to at least 2 in your second
request. You are not required to start with 1. A common practice is to use
[unix time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) for that parameter.

#### Signature

Signature is a HMAC-SHA256 encoded message containing nonce, customer ID (can
be found [here](/account/balance/)) and API key. The HMAC-SHA256 code must be
generated using a secret key that was generated with your API key. This code
must be converted to it's hexadecimal representation (64 uppercase
characters).

A short code example on how to generate a signature can be seen here:

Python  | import hmac  
import hashlib  
  
message = nonce + customer_id + api_key  
signature = hmac.new(  
    API_SECRET,  
    msg=message,  
    digestmod=hashlib.sha256  
).hexdigest().upper()
